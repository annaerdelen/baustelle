              is a video hosting platform that specializes in the processing and playback of video and audio. The platform therefore enables us to
              integrate videos into the website particularly fast and efficiently. Mux automatically adjusts the video quality to the user's bandwidth
              and only loads videos piece by piece rather than completely, which means that videos can be played and loaded very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also has excellent integration with Sanity. To upload video files, just select "Video" in the media field and upload the video
              directly to Sanity (it is handled by Mux under the hood). Mux automatically provides a preview image of the first frame of the video,
              which we display on the website while the video is loading.

              is a next-generation web hosting service. It works by being permanently connected to the website's code repository and running a build
              process through this connection when it detects updates to the codebase or when content is published. This process converts the code
              into static HTML, CSS and JS files, which are then served to website visitors via a global network of servers (called Content Delivery
              Network, CDN). This means that users receive a cached version of the websites from the server closest to them, which reduces load times
              enormously.

            I have made every effort to technically optimize the website for search engine optimization. If you have any requests for adjustments in
            this regard, please contact me. Nevertheless, content is the most important part of SEO. Simple tips to follow:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Image optimization</strong> <br />
              Use meaningful image descriptions. Not ¬ªImage of a dog¬´, but rahter ¬ªA cute golden retriever puppy plays in the sunlight in the garden
              while happily looking at a toy ball¬´.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Optimize meta tags</strong> <br />
              Consider writing meta descriptions for each page. Your can do this by opening the ¬ªSEO¬´ field at the top of every page.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Relevant keywords</strong> <br />
              Identify keywords that fit your business. Integrate them naturally into your website texts, headings and meta descriptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Qualitative content</strong> <br />
              Create high-quality, unique content. Google prefers informative and useful texts. Make sure that your content answers the questions of
              your target group.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Relevant links</strong> <br />
              The text you use for an internal link (anchor text) should be relevant to the linked content. Avoid generic phrases like "click here"
              and instead choose descriptive words that reflect the content of the target page.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Text>
      </Container>

      <Container paddingBottom={spacing.between}>

        <Text size={1}>
          <p>
            Images uploaded to Sanity are automatically compressed and converted to the WebP format. In the frontend, I use the lazy loading method,
            which means that images are only loaded when they are needed or come into the viewport. In addition, different sizes of photos are
            rendered and automatically adapted to the respective end device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, you should make sure that you do not upload images that are too large. Images that do not exceed 1MB are a good guide in
            terms of file size. However, it also depends on the dimensions ‚Äì max. 4000px on the wide side usually works well.

            For the e-commerce part of the website, we use Shopify to manage the products and Sanity for their content. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to create a new product, navigate to your Shopify dashboard and proceed from there. Make sure to give the product a title,
            upload one photo and add all important product-related information (such as price, inventory, shipping, etc.). The photo that is uploaded
            there is only displayed in the shopping cart and in the checkout process. <br />
            As soon as a product has been created or updated in Shopify, it is synced with Sanity. Sanity is now responsible for the entire content
            part, which is used for the product detail pages, among other things. To customize or create the content for the products, simply go to
            the corresponding product in Sanity.
